## 📜 Project Overview
PulseCode is a human-centered ergonomic solution to combat posture-related back pain among desk-bound individuals.  
It combines **pressure sensors**, **distance sensing**, and **vibration feedback** to help users build healthy sitting habits without intrusive devices.

---

## 🛠 Features
- **8x FSR402 pressure sensors** for seat pressure mapping
- **Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** for back distance measurement
- **ATmega328P microcontroller** for posture logic
- **Vibration motor** for subtle posture alerts
- **Custom PCB** and **SolidWorks-designed enclosures**
- **LED battery level indicator**, USB-C charging, 7.4V Li-ion battery
- Automotive-grade foam cushion

## 🔬 How It Works
1. **Posture Detection:**  
   - FSR sensors detect seating pressure patterns.  
   - Ultrasonic sensor measures back-to-backrest distance.  
2. **Processing:**  
   - ATmega328P processes sensor readings against preset thresholds.  
3. **Feedback:**  
   - Vibration motor alerts the user when posture deviates significantly.  
4. **User Control:**  
   - ON/OFF power switch + battery level check.
